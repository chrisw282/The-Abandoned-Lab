# The Abandoned Lab (Quake Deathmatch Map by Christopher Wilson)

An old research lab, said to have been left behind for many years, has been found and turned into a place of absolute war.

The theme of the level is a dark labratory that has been abandoned for years. My idea was to go for darker colors as well as old environments for better give the idea that the lab hasn't been used in years. My inspirations came from Astrobot and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.

# Wads

These are the wads that will be used for the map. I wanted to find textures that would best match the theme of being an abandoned lab, which means that I looked for darker colored textures that also looked like it could be seen in a labratory.
