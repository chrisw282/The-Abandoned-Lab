# The Abandoned Lab (Quake Deathmatch Map by Christopher Wilson)

An old research lab, said to have been left behind for many years, has been found and turned into a place of absolute war.

The theme of the level is a dark labratory that has been abandoned for years. My idea was to go for darker colors as well as old environments for better give the idea that the lab hasn't been used in years. I also wanted to include objects that are just laying around messily to give players the feeling that they're walking around in this dark lab that used to maintained but is now completely abandoned. My inspirations came from Astrobot and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.



# Wads

These are the wads that will be used for the map. I wanted to find textures that would best match the theme of being an abandoned lab, which means that I looked for darker colored textures that also looked like it could be seen in a labratory.

# Blockout Walkthrough Video

This was the very first version of the map I made. It's a lot bigger than the final version of the map and had much room for improvement. In this first version, I originally planned for there to be a fountain in the middle section of the map, but it was scrapped later on because I couldn't come up with any interesting ways to make it flow with the rest of the level. The map contained a big middle part, with multiple rooms that connected with each other, as well as an elevated section that players can walk up and access. This early version of the map contained many rooms and pathways which resulted in the map being too big. In the finalized version of the map, some of the unnecessary rooms and paths have been removed/scaled down.

# Texturing

Immersion and Theme:

I wanted to use textures that would most likely be seen in a labratory.

This texture of a bookshelf is evoking the theme because it's something you'd see inside a lab. Another way it's evoking the theme is that the bookshelf is leaning on the wall instead of sitting straight because no one has been there for years to keep the lab maintained.

Guiding and Orientation:

I wanted to use appealing textures to guide players to certain areas that can be reached in more than one way.

I decided to once again use these bookshelfs to evoke the abandoned theme, but I placed them like this so the player can get the idea to jump up on them to access the elevated portion.

# Lighting Markdown

Immersion and Theme: 

With a theme like this, lighting is pretty important because you have to know how much light is enough. I chose to light up the most important parts of the map.

This is one of the main rooms and since the level needed some lighting, I wanted the most important rooms to have at least some light. It will make the player think that this room was once used as the main room for experiments.

Guiding and Orientation: 

I wanted to use lighting to guide players into the important sections of the map, but I also wanted to use dark spaces to hide secrets as well.

In this dark spot is a armor power up. It's completely hidden in the dark and the only way you'll know that it's there when you play for the first time is if you choose to walk into the dark spot, which players will curiously do because it's one of the only spots in the map that have no light.
